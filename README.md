## MEDC0080 – RDKit tutorial

**10am–12pm at TBD**

---

### Summary

Python is a versatile programming language widely used in science due to its simplicity and extensive libraries. RDKit is an open-source *cheminformatics* toolkit that provides powerful tools for computational chemistry, making it important for molecular modelling and drug discovery.

The aim of this session is to provide you with the foundational building blocks of Python programming within a *cheminformatics* context, enabling you to further develop your coding skills and apply them in your work.

⏰ To make the most of the session, please try to complete the installation process beforehand. This will allow you to spend the session time effectively, focusing on exploring the self-paced tutorial content and addressing any questions you may have.

⚠️ **Remember to bring your laptop!**

### Instructions for Google Colab (preferred environment)

We recommend using **Google Colab**, which allows you to run the tutorial notebooks directly in your browser without installing anything.  
You must be logged into a Google account. If you do not have one, you will need to create one.

The same tutorial folder provided on Moodle is also hosted publicly on GitHub and accessible via the links below:

| Notebook | Colab link |

### Local setup with Anaconda (optional)

If you prefer to run the tutorial locally using the Anaconda distribution, this option is also available.

After downloading the `RDKitTutorial` folder from Moodle, it may appear with a date appended to its name (e.g. `RDKitTutorial-yyyymmdd`).  
Please rename the folder to `RDKitTutorial` (no spaces) to ensure consistency with the instructions.

Inside the folder, you will find two setup guides:

- `instructions_installation.txt`  
  For step-by-step instructions to install Anaconda and configure the required `conda` environment on your own computer.

- `instructions_ucl.txt`  
  For using the UCL Desktop Anywhere virtual desktop environment.

You can also preview the notebooks as static HTML files inside the `html/` subdirectory.  
Note that this format does not support running or editing code.
