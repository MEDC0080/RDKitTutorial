    "# 01 – Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Authored by: *Fredrik Svensson, Oliver Scott*  \n",
    "Edited by: *Florion Peni*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the links in the [Contents](#contents) section to navigate the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a brief and general introduction to how programming with Python works. If you are already familiar with the basics, you may wish to skip ahead to [`02_rdkit_introduction.ipynb`](02_rdkit_introduction.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Please run the code cells in order**. Skipping cells may result in errors due to missing variables or imports.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook works in both:\n",
    "- **Local JupyterLab installations** (e.g. via Anaconda)\n",
    "- **Google Colab** (run in your browser with no prior setup required)\n",
    "\n",
    "File handling instructions (e.g. loading from disk) may differ depending on your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python** is a popular general-purpose programming language. It is especially common in scientific computing due to its readability and rich ecosystem of libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### JupyterLab / Google Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "**JupyterLab** is an open-source interface for running and sharing notebooks with code and text.  \n",
    "**Google Colab** is a cloud-based version of Jupyter that runs in your browser and connects to free GPUs and TPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *When working in Colab, any files saved in the runtime (e.g. downloaded datasets or generated outputs) are temporary and will be deleted when you close the tab or your session times out.*  \n",
    "You can view runtime files by clicking the folder icon in the left-hand toolbar. If you are working with important files, make sure to download them to your local machine or save them to Google Drive before ending your session.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you make edits to this notebook and would like to save them you can save your own copy by clicking on **File > Save a copy in Drive** in the top menu. This ensures your work is preserved even after you close the runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extra resources\n",

    "\n",
    "Variables are one of the most important components of a programming language. Variables are used to store information. This gives a short hand notation to refer to potentially large amounts of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can assign data to variables using the `=` symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "variable = data\n",

    "\n",
    "Once we have assigned data to a variable we can then access that data using the variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "When naming a variable it is best practice to give it a name which describes the data it holds. We use underscores `_` to make variable names easier to read. Blank spaces cannot be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_long_variable_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that Python contains keywords that **should not** be used as variable names. This is because they have explicit functions in Python. In Jupyter and Colab you will be able to tell a keyword when it is automatically highlighted. [Here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_keywords.asp) is a list of reserved keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: *Python is a dynamically typed language and therefore the type of a variable does not need to be specified. If you are familiar with statically typed languages (e.g. C, C++, Java) this may seem a little unusual.*"

    "In many Python workflows, especially in data science and cheminformatics, you will often need to load data from external files for further analysis or processing.\n",

    "with open('path_to_file') as f:\n",
    "    # do something with the file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `with` ensures the file is properly closed after reading, even if an error occurs.\n",
    "* `'path_to_file'` is the location of the file on your system.\n",
    "* `as f` assigns the file object to the variable `f`, which you can then use to access its content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the tutorial folder, we have included a subdirectory named `data` that contains a sample text file: `lorem_ipsum.txt`. Its relative path is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "data/lorem_ipsum.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, file handling differs slightly between **JupyterLab** (running locally) and **Google Colab** (running in the cloud). To make this notebook work in both environments, the code below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Automatically detects whether the notebook is running in Colab\n",
    "* Downloads the file from GitHub if necessary (in Colab)\n",
    "* Then reads and prints the file contents\n"
