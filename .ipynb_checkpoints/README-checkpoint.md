## MEDC0080 ‚Äì RDKit tutorial

**10am‚Äì12pm at TBD**

---

### Summary

Python is a versatile programming language widely used in science due to its simplicity and extensive libraries. RDKit is an open-source *cheminformatics* toolkit that provides powerful tools for computational chemistry, making it important for molecular modelling and drug discovery.

The aim of this session is to provide you with the foundational building blocks of Python programming within a *cheminformatics* context, enabling you to further develop your coding skills and apply them in your work.

‚è∞ To make the most of the session, please try to complete the installation process beforehand. This will allow you to spend the session time effectively, focusing on exploring the self-paced tutorial content and addressing any questions you may have.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Remember to bring your laptop!**

### Setup instructions if you wish to install Anaconda in your own computer

After downloading the `RDKitTutorial` folder from Moodle (click the **"Download folder"** button), it may appear with a date appended to its name, such as `RDKitTutorial-yyyymmdd`.  
**Please rename the folder to `RDKitTutorial`** (no spaces) to ensure consistency with the instructions.

Inside it, you will find two sets of setup instructions:

- **Local installation:**  
  Refer to the `instructions_installation.txt` file. It provides OS-specific steps to install the Anaconda distribution and configure the required `conda` environment.

- **Using Desktop@UCL Anywhere:**  
  If you're accessing UCL's virtual desktop service, follow the steps in `instructions_ucl.txt` instead.

You can also preview the tutorial content in static form via the HTML files located in the `html/` subdirectory.  
*Note: These HTML notebooks are read-only and do not support code execution.*
