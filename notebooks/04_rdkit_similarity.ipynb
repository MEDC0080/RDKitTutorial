    "## Molecular similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecular similarity is one of the most important concepts in cheminformatics, referring to the comparison of molecules based on either their **structural** or **functional** properties. This comparison has many applications, particularly in identifying new molecules with desired properties and biological activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ***molecular similarity principle*** states that structurally similar molecules often share similar properties and biological activities, a concept encapsulated in ***structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies***. In virtual screening, this principle is leveraged to identify potential active molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Given a set of molecules with known biological activity, similarity searching can be used to find additional candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the idea of molecular similarity is conceptually simple, it is a complex and multifaceted concept in practice. The way similarity is measured depends on the application and requires three key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A **molecular representation** that encodes molecular structure or chemical features.\n",
    "2. A **weighting** of the representation's features, *if applicable*.\n",
    "3. A **similarity function or coefficient** to combine information and calculate a similarity score.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Molecular representation\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of molecular representation has a significant impact on similarity calculations. Different representations are suited to different applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Molecular descriptors\n",
    "\n",
    "**1D descriptors**\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: molecular weight, logP, number of rotatable bonds, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- These provide a single value for the entire molecule, thus they are also known as global descriptors.\n",
    "- Often combined with 2D fingerprints to enhance representation.\n",
    "- Do not reflect local regions of similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2D descriptors**\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: Molecular graphs, fragments, local atom environments, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- These represent localised molecular features.\n",
    "- They are high-dimensional descriptors as they encode many features per molecule.\n",
    "- Often referred to as *fingerprints* and commonly used for similarity searching and virtual screening.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3D descriptors**\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: Shape, stereochemistry, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can encode spatial information but depend on the conformation used.\n",
    "- More complex and less robust than 2D descriptors due to the many possible conformations a molecule can adopt.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Biological similarity**\n",
    "- Requires experimental activity data.\n",
    "- Often independent of molecular structure.\n",
    "- Biological fingerprints may encode activity against various biological targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [`02_rdkit_introduction.ipynb`](02_rdkit_introduction.ipynb), we explored how to calculate some molecular descriptors. For a full list of available descriptors in RDKit, refer to the [documentation](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html#list-of-available-descriptors). In this notebook, we will focus on 2D and 3D descriptors, particularly molecular fingerprints.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "## Molecular fingerprints\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecular fingerprints encode the structure of a molecule into a vector of binary digits (*bits*). Each bit indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of a specific feature, such as a particular substructure. Comparing these fingerprints using molecular similarity metrics allows us to calculate the similarity between two molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structural keys\n",
    "\n",
    "The earliest type of fingerprint, a **structural key**, is a bit vector where each bit corresponds to a predefined structural feature (encoded by **SMARTS patterns**). For example, the Molecular ACCess System (MACCS) key encodes 166 predefined substructures. *MACCS keys are available in RDKit.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Structural keys are interpretable but less generalisable than modern approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Circular fingerprints (Morgan, ECFP)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Circular fingerprints**, such as those generated by the *Morgan* algorithm, encode circular environments around each atom. The fingerprintâ€™s radius determines how many neighboring atoms and bonds are included in the circular environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i></i>\n",

    "\n",
    "These environments are hashed into a numeric representation that determines which bits in the fingerprint are set. To ensure fixed-length fingerprints, they are often *folded* to a desired length.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFPs)*, based on a variant of the Morgan algorithm, are widely used in cheminformatics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing exactly how they are generated is beyond the scope of this tutorial. For more details, see the [RDKit documentation on Morgan fingerprints](http://www.rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html#morgan-fingerprints-circular-fingerprints) or [this publication](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ci100050t).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Molecular similarity measures\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of similarity metric is as important as the molecular representation. Different metrics emphasise different aspects of similarity. For binary fingerprints, two of the most common metrics are the **Tanimoto** and **Dice coefficients**. \n",
    "These metrics form the basis for comparing molecular fingerprints and assessing the similarity between molecules. The choice of metric depends on the specific application.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tanimoto coefficient \n",
    "\n",
    "$$T_{c}(A,B)=\\frac{c}{a+b-c}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dice coefficient \n",
    "\n",
    "$$D_{c}(A,B)=\\frac{c}{\\frac{1}{2}(a + b)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **a**: Number of features present in molecule A (*on-bits*).\n",
    "- **b**: Number of features present in molecule B (*on-bits*).\n",
    "- **c**: Number of features shared between molecules A and B (*intersection*).\n",

    "## Selecting diverse molecules with the MaxMin algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, it may be important to select a set of molecules that are as diverse as possible to assess the chemical space of a compound library. One of the most efficient ways to achieve this is by using the **MaxMin algorithm**, described in [this paper](http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/3570/).\n",
    "\n",
    "*The algorithm works in 4 steps, as described below.*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate molecular descriptors**: Compute descriptors (e.g. Morgan fingerprints) for all molecules in the dataset, including the query molecules (if provided) and the candidate pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initial seed selection**: If no initial query molecules are provided, select one molecule at random from the candidate pool as the starting point for the *picked set*.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **MaxMin selection**: For each subsequent selection, identify the molecule from the candidate pool that has the *maximum value of its minimum distance* to the molecules already in the picked set. This ensures that the selected molecule is as diverse as possible from those already picked.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Repeat until completion**: Continue selecting molecules based on the MaxMin rule until the desired number of molecules is chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "RDKit provides an implementation of this algorithm in the `MaxMinPicker` class. Letâ€™s apply it to the set of approved drugs we have been working with in previous notebooks to demonstrate how to select a diverse subset of molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is particularly useful for exploring chemical diversity in large datasets, selecting training sets for machine learning models, or identifying representative compounds for downstream analyses.\n",
