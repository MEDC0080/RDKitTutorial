1) Download the "RDKitTutorial" folder from Moodle. Extract it and move it to the Desktop.
   Rename it to "RDKitTutorial" (no spaces) if downloaded by a different name.

2) From the UCL Application Store, search for and open the application “Anaconda for Windows 
   2024.02.1 (Python)”.

3) From the "Home" tab, launch the "Powershell Prompt" application.

4) Change to the N-drive by entering the following on the command line:
      
       N:

5) Navigate to the "RDKitTutorial" folder by entering:

       cd DesktopSettings\Desktop\RDKitTutorial

6) Tell conda you want to work from the N-drive by entering:
   
       SET CONDA_ENVS_PATH=N:\DEVELOPMENT

7) Now execute the installation script by entering:

       python install\install.py

   This process takes at least 1 hour. Ensure your device stays connected throughout.

8) Enter the following command:

       conda activate rdkit_tutorial

9) Launch the tutorial content by entering:

       jupyter lab

10) Jupyter Lab should open up in the default web browser. You should now be able to access all 
    of the tutorial material by navigating to the tutorial folder (Desktop\RDKitTutorial).

    If the software does not open automatically look for the following lines on the prompt:

        [I 2025-mm-dd tt:tt:tt.ttt ServerApp] Jupyter Server x.xx.x is running at:
        [I 2025-mm-dd tt:tt:tt.ttt ServerApp] http://localhost:yyyy/lab?token=zzzz...

    These lines on your system will be slightly different. Copy and paste the 
    "http://localhost:yyyy..." address on the address bar of a web browser (e.g. Chrome) and 
    press Enter (↵).

11) Double click on '01_python_intro.ipynb' to open the introductory notebook.
