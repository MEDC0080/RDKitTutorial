#### INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ####
###################################

1) Install Anaconda for your operating system from the link below (choose Graphical Installer):

       https://www.anaconda.com/download/success

   Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for 
   scientific computing (data science, machine learning applications, large-scale data 
   processing, predictive analytics, etc.), that aims to simplify package management and 
   deployment.

2) Follow the installation instructions:

       https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/

3) Download the "RDKitTutorial" folder from Moodle. Extract/unzip it (if necessary) and move it 
   to your Desktop. Rename it to "RDKitTutorial" (no spaces) if downloaded by a different name.

For the next steps follow the instructions based on your operating system.
