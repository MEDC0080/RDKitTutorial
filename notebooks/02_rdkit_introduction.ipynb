    "\n",
    "Authored by: *Fredrik Svensson, Oliver Scott*\n",
    "\n",
    "Edited by: *Florion Peni*\n",
    "\n",
    "Please ensure you complete [`01_python_introduction.ipynb`](01_python_introduction.ipynb) before proceeding with the **RDKit-focused content** in this notebook. If you are already familiar with Python basics, you may skip the introduction and continue with this material.\n",

    "### What is RDKit?\n",
    "\n",
    "**RDKit** is an open-source cheminformatics and machine-learning toolkit written in C++ and Python. It provides powerful tools for computational chemistry and molecular modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What will we learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "RDKit is a comprehensive toolkit with too many functions to cover in a single session. To make learning manageable, we have selected a set of essential utilities frequently used by computational chemists. These topics are organised into notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **reading and writing molecular structures**: [`02_rdkit_introduction.ipynb`](02_rdkit_introduction.ipynb),\n",
    "- **working with molecular structures**: [`02_rdkit_introduction.ipynb`](02_rdkit_introduction.ipynb),\n",
    "- **substructure searching and filtering**: [`03_rdkit_substructure.ipynb`](03_rdkit_substructure.ipynb),\n",
    "- and **molecular similarity**: [`04_rdkit_similarity.ipynb`](04_rdkit_similarity.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will cover the basics of RDKit, focusing on how to read, write, and manipulate molecular structures. For further learning, explore the [official RDKit Documentation](http://rdkit.org/docs/index.html).\n",

    "SMILES is a widely used text-based representation of molecules.\n",

    "- Atoms are represented by their atomic symbols (e.g., C, O, F, Br, etc.).\n",
    "- Double bonds are represented by `=`.\n",
    "- Triple bonds are represented by `#`.\n",
    "- Rings are represented by matching pairs of digits (e.g., benzene: `c1ccccc1`).\n",
    "- Branching is indicated using parentheses.\n",
