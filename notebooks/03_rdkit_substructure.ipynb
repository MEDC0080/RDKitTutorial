    "Substructure searching and filtering is a fundamental tool in cheminformatics. It involves identifying a specific pattern (*subgraph*) within a molecule (*graph*). This process is widely used in various cheminformatics applications involving digital representations of molecules, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **depiction**: highlighting functional groups within a molecule,\n",
    "- **drug design**: searching databases and performing Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) analyses,\n",
    "- and **analytical chemistry**: searching for previously characterised structures and comparing data to that of an unknown molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Substructure searching is ubiquitous and integral to cheminformatics workflows. For example, you have likely used substructure searching in online databases such as [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/), [DrugBank](https://go.drugbank.com/), and [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).\n",

    "## SMARTS\n",
    "\n",
    "**SMiles ARbitrary Target Specification (SMARTS)** is an extension of SMILES that allows users to define substructural patterns within molecules. Its expressive syntax supports precise and transparent substructure specification and atom typing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most SMILES strings are also valid SMARTS strings.** The key difference between SMILES and SMARTS lies in the introduction of logical operators (e.g., `!`, `&`, `,`, `;`) and special atomic and bond symbols (e.g., `*`, `~`). These additions allow SMARTS atoms and bonds to be more general.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the SMARTS atomic symbol `[C,N]` represents an atom that can be either aliphatic carbon (C) or aliphatic nitrogen (N).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Using SMARTS patterns, we can define key molecular features like hydrogen bond (HB) donors and acceptors. This is helpful for applying Lipinski's Rule of Five (Ro5).\n",
    "\n",
    "Uppercase atomic symbols represent aliphatic atoms, whereas lowercase atomic symbols represent aromatic atoms. The notation `#Z` matches any atom with the atomic number *Z*, regardless of its chemical environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HB donors**: Nitrogen or oxygen atoms with at least one directly bonded hydrogen atom.  \n",
    "  >`[N,n,O;!H0]` or `[#7,#8;!H0]`;\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **HB acceptors**: Nitrogen or oxygen atoms (aliphatic or aromatic).  \n",
    "  >`[N,n,O,o]` or `[#7,#8]`\n",
    "\n",
    "These patterns can be made more complex for more precise matching, depending on the application. For more detailed information, consult the following resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A comprehensive guide to SMARTS is available on the [Daylight website](https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smarts.html).\n",
    "- The [SMARTS Plus](https://smartsview.zbh.uni-hamburg.de/) tool is useful for exploring and visualising SMARTS patterns.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Some substructures can be undesirable due to properties like **toxicity** or **high reactivity**. With the advent of high-throughput screening (HTS), the need to filter out problematic compounds from screening libraries has grown.\n",

    "\n",
    "**PAINS** are chemical compounds known to often produce false positive results in HTS. These compounds tend to react non-specifically with a wide range of biological targets rather than selectively affecting the desired target. When designing screening libraries, it is beneficial to filter out PAINS to improve the reliability of screening results.\n",
